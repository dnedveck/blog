I've found meditation helpful in learning how to deal with stressful times, primarily when I have a lot of projects going on at once. Mainly I fail at completing work during this time because I can't stop churning through all the things that I have to do, I become overwhelmed, and end up not getting important things done.

Mindfulness meditation has helped me clear my mind and focus on one project at a time. 

[UCLA](http://marc.ucla.edu/body.cfm?id=22) has some nice guided meditations that I used to get into it -- doing the 12 min "Breath, Sound, Body Meditation" every day for a week was good. At the end of the week I started understanding the terms they used to describe the meditation experience.


I've been taking this further by reading Waking Up by Sam Harris ([Amazon Link](http://amzn.to/1LIt0HN)), and that has been interesting more to explore conciousness. Sam Harris has some guided meditations on SoundCloud ([9min](https://soundcloud.com/samharrisorg/mindfulness-meditation-9), [26min](https://soundcloud.com/samharrisorg/mindfulness-meditation-26)), and you can find them on YouTube as well.
