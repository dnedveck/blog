## What we did

- brainstormed questions for the datasets
- formed groups to work on refining questions
 - work in your groups on this, and share the google doc with my by Friday night
- continued working on the summarize taxa assignment
- little bit of lecture on t-tests and stats / p values
 - Remember: *p-value is the chance that you would observe the data given the null is true* 
- Started working on the visualizing of taxa plots in R.


## Finishing up the `summarize_taxa_through_plots.py`

so remember from last time how we used the bash scripts to run the summarize_taxa_through_plots scripts.
We're going to continue to do that with the QIIME plotting that is looking at the category.
To do that, let's copy our original sumtaxa.sh

	cp sumtaxa.sh sumtaxa_body.sh

Then go into the `sumtaxa_body.sh` and modify the output directory, and add the right `-c` flag
it should look like:

	#! /bin/bash
	
	module load qiime/1.7.0
	
	summarize_taxa_through_plots.py \
    	    -i ~/otu_picking/output/otu_table_d8000.biom \
        	-o taxa_summary_bodysite \
	       	-m ~/../shared/HMP_5BS_mapping.txt \
	        -c 'BodySite'
	        
After you have run both of those, scp it back home, to your home computer. Here's what I ran

	 scp -r  dnedveck@login.msi.umn.edu:~/summarize_taxa/taxa* .

Note the `taxa*`, the `*` acts as a wild card, and matches anything that begins with taxa, which are the two folders that I want to download.

Once you download the directories, look in the `taxa_summary_plots/` directories, and look at the html files to view the graphs. 

### Starting work on the Taxa Summary in R

click on the moodle link for the taxa summary in R -- it should bring up an internet page.

Open up RStudio, and make a new script. They are giving us a new script in this Taxa Summary page, and we are going to put it into a script file.

Scroll down the page until you see the definition of the `taxa_lev_sum()` function. It's the part with all of the code.

Copy that all into the R script we just made. Make sure you get the last trailing brace. 
Once it's pasted into the RScript file, go up to the corner of the script window and click source. 
The function should now be loaded into memory. You can check by looking at the Environment pane, and you should see the name of the function there.

Now to load your data.
Download the `HMP_5BS_metadata.txt` from moodle. 
You're going to need to `scp` the rarefied OTU table that you made during the alpha rarefaction step to load that into R.

once you have those two files, set your working directory to where they are located, and:

	otutable <- read.delim(file = "otu_table_d8000.txt", skip =1, comment.char = "", header = TRUE)

	hmb.mapping <- read.delim(file = "HMP_5BS_metadata.txt", header = TRUE)
	
That should bring them in, and that is as far as we got today.
